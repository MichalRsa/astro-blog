As I earned my first cloud certification recently, I'm looking back at my approach with a fresh perspective and some valuable lessons. So, in this blog post, I'm going to take you through how I started, open up on what worked for me, and chat about the changes I'd make if I had to do it all over again.

### TL;DR

Stephane Mareek's - [Ultimate AWS Certified Developer Associate 2023 NEW DVA-C02](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-dva-c01/) and
[https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01/](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-tests-dva-c01/)

Tutorials Dojo practice exams - [AWS Certified Developer Associate DVA-C02 Practice Exams 2023](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/aws-certified-developer-associate-practice-exams/)

These resources are enough to pass the exam confidently. Just go through Stepahne's course. Then, take preparation exams (go through failed questions) and retake failed exams.

### Time

So, I underestimated the time needed for proper preparation. I watched multiple videos where people were telling me that they prepared for it in 3-4 weeks. However, I didn't take into consideration that they already passed at least one AWS exam. Ultimately, I needed almost three months to feel confident (almost) enough to attempt the exam.

### Confidence

In my perspective, the exam questions tend to be so complex that you are rarely 100% sure that the chosen question is proper. You focus on eliminating the ones that sound the most stupid. And usually, you end up with two questions that seem okay. Even when I was getting 90% on preparation exams, before seeing the score I was not sure if I passed it.

### Learning approach

In the beginning, I completely wasted my time trying to mindlessly note the lessons in my Obsidian app and never go back to repeat the information.

If learning the second time for the exam I would take the approach of freely going through Stephane's Udemy lessons, not memorizing everything. But grasping ideas behind some of the services. And use a noting technique called mind mapping (see example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1WhjPh3ZQ4)). It's a good tool to help memorize AWS services and their connections. Having a visual representation of the whole AWS infrastructure helps you visualize the ecosystem and allows you to find a proper place in the official documentation when you need to deepen your knowledge. If you know how this stuff works together, then you have to memorize all these properties like deployment modes or DynamoDB throughout. Despite this questions are not often on the exam I would not attempt it without this knowledge.

### Taking practice exams

When having an idea of how the AWS ecosystem works. You can start to take practice exams. By far that's the most important step. Take a singular exam and go through the wrong and good answers, then dig into the docs. If done properly, it takes a day or more.

It is the most important step, I would spend at least two weeks going through the practice exams, and explanation of the questions.

### What practice exams did I take?

#### Cloud guru

These are the easiest exams. I would say most similar to the real ones. You can go through them with a one-week free trial of Cloud Guru subscription.

#### Stephane Mareek, Abhishek Singh

These have a little harder, more complex, and in-depth questions. You are getting 6 exams with different sets of questions so it is worth going through every one of them. If you can pass these exams after retake. You can assume that you are ready.

#### Tutorials Dojo

The hardest ones. They give extra confidence. I decided to buy them after seeing multiple positive opinions in the Reddit threads. Even when passing Stephane Mareek courses, when I started doing Tutorials Dojo exams I was getting like a 60%. It asks in-depth questions, I would not expect many like this on a real exam. But it allows you to dig into the various topics, so then taking the real exam it feels like it only scratches the surface. And questions are not that scary anymore.

### The Real exam

The real exam doesn't seem that hard. It has basic questions, rather focusing on specific AWS services than some general architecture/networking questions. Stephane has good insights during the course when he says that this question or similar can show up on the exam, so focus on remembering them.

In my case, the exam contained a lot of similar questions. Specifically multiple questions about HSM or SSM Parameter Store. So knowing the basics about them, I gained multiple points, feeling like I answered the same question.

### Is building AWS projects worth it?

I don't know but, if you only care about passing the exam, probably not. You get the most value by trying the prep exams. You just learn the way exam questions are constructed, so you know what to expect from the real exam.

Personally, I had a little experience building things on AWS (like this website). But I wouldn't say it taught me a lot. Specifically, if the exams require in-depth knowledge. You don't really learn this when building a project. You search for information on AD HOC when you need some specific solution.
